# Bicycle_E-Kit
## Overview
Considering the increased popularity of bicycles recently we decided to design a
product which would enhance the overall experience of the rider.
The product includes;
- a dark activated light system
- anti theft alarm system which gives off an alarm if somebody touches the lock when the bicycle is locked
- turn indicating signal light system
- a speedometer.

## Components,PCB and Enclosure

NE555 timer ICs are used for both the lock and the signal lights.ATMega32
microcontroller is programmed to build the speedometer.
We designed and constructed two PCBs for our system using Altium.Also an
enclosure was designed and constructed using Solidworks software.
Finally the system was fixed on a bicycle to demonstrate the working prototype of
our product.
